The OpenCV implementation of HMAX, supplied by APL.

  - bin: executable and MATLAB code for using HMAX-OCV. There's code to format
    patch sets for APL and HMAX_FE, as well as to compute new C2 activations and
    read them into the format typically produced by HMAX-MATLAB.

  - images: a temporary directory used by hmaxOCV.m for storing resized images
    while calculating C2 features.

  - patchSets: patch-sets stored in the format necessary for HMAX-OCV. The *.mat
    files are structs formatted for APL's use. The *.xml files are the resultant
    patch sets, used by HMAX_FE. 

  - README: this file

  - src: source code for compiling HMAX_FE, the executable that actually
    produces C2 activations.
