======

APL has written an OpenCV implementation of HMAX significantly faster than
HMAX-MATLAB, particularly on multi-core machines. In this directory, you'll find
the executable, "HMAX_FE", and related utilities:

  - aplPatches2xmlPatches.m: convert APL patch struct to XML patch file

  - featureExtractionShell.sh: a wrapper for HMAX_FE
  
  - HMAX_FE: the actual openCV implementation of HMAX, a binary executable

  - hmaxOCV.m: a MATLAB wrapper for HMAX_FE, generates a set of C2 activations

  - matlabPatches2aplPatches.m: convert HMAX-MATLAB patch information to an APL
    patch struct

  - README: this file

  - read_OpenCV_xml.m: APL-supplied utility for reading XML

  - write_OpenCV_xml.m: APL-supplied utility for writing XML

  - xmlC22matC2.m: read C2 responses for image files

  - xmlSchema.txt: the definition of an APL patch struct.
